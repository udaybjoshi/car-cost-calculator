## Project Description

The Car Cost Calculator is a Python-based command-line application designed to assist users in comparing the financial implications of purchasing one of two different vehicles. By factoring in loan interest rates, taxes, fees, gas prices, and maintenance costs, the calculator provides an estimate of the monthly cost associated with each car. It aims to streamline the car buying experience by focusing on the essential financial elements, ensuring that the user is not overwhelmed by unnecessary questions. This tool is invaluable for anyone considering a car purchase in the US and looking to understand the full financial impact of their decision.
